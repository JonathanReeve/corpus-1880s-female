 thank god 
 tired 
 wish call 
 

 eyes full tears 
 fall arms 
throat kissed lay
dying leaving evermore

 
murmured

 face pale
 head swam limbs trembled 
 hand wounded wrapped 
linen throbbed ached 
ready 

 
 call memory debtor
 sacrifice

 old heroic light shone eyes
 old high courage heart
 live solitude 
silence wished knew
 wild thyme dewy
woodmoss moors 
 

 day world 
tired strength failed 
 remember

 silent cruel knowledge
 mind cruel dilemma beset 
 remembered ties passions

 tapestry wall 
 painted chamber 
 wavered moved hand pushed 
 petulance aside gloom 
 came woman white 
swan throat hair 
 nimbus collar old
jewels set silver throat moved
 calm slow undulating wore
 soft shining texture white 
 lights shadows swan

world taught sorcery 
 skill power 
 pandects time

 hand shoulder 
laughed little noiselessly

 glanced poor grey sustained
traveltired form saw 

 mine smile

courtesan head
drooped ashamed bitterly ashamed

 envied dead carrion lay

 living 

musa stood mute eyes fastened 
 beautiful soulless white

followed marble stairs
 darkness night gone 
lost wilderness eome

 lost beauty youth likeness

wide open stars staring wondering

 seventh morning came 

 redbreasts singing amidst
 tombs
 cold ashes 
spent fire stones

 kissed rim lips 
touch kneeled latin
prayer god care 
wondered dully

 little timid mountain
birds came stillness tombs

thither day having sought 
city downs hills vain
 lay asleep face downward

 evergreen alterius grew closer 
closer entrance etruscan
grave wove impenetrable 
veil light 
wild birds hunted hare seeking 
refuge enter 

 defended death sheltered
 life woodlark 
 amidst woods purge balm
 spikenard wild grew
