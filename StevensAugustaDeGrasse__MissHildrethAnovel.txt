 silent resistless steps

 farewell eternity

truly ivor tolskoi vengeance complete
 patouchki cruel sentence 
carried letter vladimir
mellikoff linked lallovich passed
onward desolate gehenna siberian
exile

 russia forgets russia 
forgives

 day month
 october tremain stepped 
 railway train stood solitary
traveller platform open
station bretons high rolling
white hills hampshire

 open waggon drawn sturdy
mountain ponies waiting 
rustic platform sprang
 driver cracked whip accompanying
 shrill whistle 
willing little creatures started

 steep winding roads 
 swift gallop 

 tremain sudden recollection 
 newbolds park ponies irreproachable
basket phaeton laughed aloud dissimilarity
 present
primitive conveyance contrast 
 solemn hills wooded slopes 
 suburban ornamental prettiness 
environed folly

 stretched grand white
mountain range 
verduretipped sides washington 
clefts snowcrowned peak side
 richest prevailed 
crimson sugar gold 
 beech birch russet brown oak 
sombre green hemlock keen pinescented
breeze swept past swaying tall
goldenrod blue asters shaking 
bittersweet perfume purple gentian
 grew mountain side

 road wound growing
steeper steeper mile fringed
 side tall ferns grasses brown

bracken starred late 
oxeyed daisies right 
steep mountains head 
 beautiful wild ammonoouc leapt
 stone stone dashed rivulets
 lichencovered boulders breaking
 creamy foam

 bade charioteer 
climbing highsided vehicle
 gathered nosegay wild white
daisies adding beech leaf 
setoff pure petals 
smile lips took place 
 taciturn jehu 
 swinging gallop

 roseate glow 
lighting western heavens 
 phoebus sinking rest 
arms grey clouds came
 low house built projecting
spur rock 
twixt earth sky looked 
stiff northeaster short work 

 walls foundations house 
painted dull venetian red covered
 creepers wild vines brilliant
 rows geraniums marking
 casement

 glowed bird tropical
plumage alighted suddenly cooler
neutral tints northern land
