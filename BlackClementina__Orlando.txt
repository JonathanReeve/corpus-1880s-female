 won poetic scotch
phrase winner 
loser comes fight soiled 
 armour bruised 
limbs weary smile anticipation
 breathing untried
strength lay hearing 
 murmur unseen waves 
lived youth understood
 slow sweetening crude
purpose ripe slow broadening
 narrow wider fields 
gradual growth soul 
aspirations second pausing place 

 clothed
 apart
 inner spirit truths
 known name 
knew face face lived 
 felt breath 
opening eyes immeasurable blue
 lay trying fasten fetters 
speech letting soul
breathe 
silence deep reverent communion
slowly stillness deepened blue
deepened noon 
rising turned homeward meet 
life meet face
 fitted dreams 
woman full soul answer
