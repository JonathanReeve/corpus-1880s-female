 teach eschew evil beauty
 sure bait godless faculty
reproachfully lepelletier morals 
terribly lax gardener judgment

 faculty conducted 
 room redolent dried lavender 
camphor scents spotless linen sheets
 taken aired girl 
 impetuous apparently
heartbroken flung 
open window leaves vine
 clematis flowers shook beneath grasp
 hands

 lovely morning cornfields
lay stupefied hall 
park humming insects
 vine leaves lowing cows

 deep bay hound broke 
silence

 eyes lit sombre feverish
brightness alighted barred windows
 wing mansion

 lonely sobbed 
 prison seeing
 picture regent street setting 
 business eyes
follow night turning thoughts
making wretched driving 
 heard glance sigh frown
bringing misery 
 wonder
