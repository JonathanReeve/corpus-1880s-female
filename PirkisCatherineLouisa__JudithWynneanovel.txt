ached soul grown
 strong 
 felt 
perforce drove old
 creep
 thief house 
read faces prayer

 heard forgotten

 

 keep silence longer
 room quite dark big
fire burned low lamps 
 lighted xo face
 hurriedly chair

ah cruel cruel low
passionate tones 
keep truth lost
theirs 

 forced lips
 turned abruptly quitted 
room

 looked keenly wolfss
troubled face

 pride humility
 keep apart
 bluntly life 
 couldn 

 time life 
 turned mentor elder brother

wolf word 
chair room

 big hall lamps 

lighted curtains drawn coming 
 dark room light dazzling
wolf shade eyes hand
 distinguish farther end 
 hall standing glass doors 
opened terrace

outside garden lay pure unsullied
sheet snow storm 
 clear full sailing overhead
flooding mountain wood valley
 silver light

 small dark figure standing outside
 doorway showed ghostlike
 white snow 
feet white overhead
 face upturned curious
questioning look born half 
half pain truth asking
 question 
 brother minute ago
 whit difficult 
solution 

 wonder wolf
eeece somewhat complex nature pride
 frequently masqueraded humility 

humility pride doubted
 times quite sure
 

 came strong kindly voice 
 elbow start 
tremble

child child 
 years ago 
laurels garden 
troubles 

 question arm
 crept round waist 
 drawing nearer 
 head rested breast

 turned pale face meet
 dark 

 troubles 
softly

 passionately
 held close tight 
heart time 
 doing casting 
lot miserable past 
redeem end life 
 ease wealth 

 toiler hard toiler 
outside gardenwall 

 head 
breast sweet solemn 
 old time 

 thou goes 
thou dies die 
buried naught death thee
 

 naught death 
 firmly clasped hands 
 labour
outside gardenwall

 gipsies tramps 
 set poor sinners atone
time formed wolf east
london parishioners whit lawless
 squalid gipsy tramp 
 emphatically outside gardenwall
 herd israelites

 end
