marriage

 farewell farewell dear winnington
 tears running cheeks
 thank kindness

take care exclaimed
 surgeon reached 
coach step need 

laugh legs light
 matters old mine feel
 bruises easier cured 
 sure dear
 forget promised 
 visit fail
 claim 

 shook hands winnington
 bent kiss brother

 boy whispered
 serve 
winnington return kindness
 

 
 boy mamma 

 right winnington 
closed door bang coach
rolled onwards

 remained lost 
came hall aware 
festivities morning taken

place leaned forward looked 
 window

 close lodge gates
 coach took sudden swerve 
give place chariotandfour 
bowling 
hall oldfashioned style day
 contained ailsaa bride

 prepared 
glance encountered theirs bowed
 quite unconscious 
 returned 
 crimson blush overspread face 
 remained perfectly calm needed 
 convince completely 
 forgotten 

 momentary meeting
 looked carriage 
passed leaving cloud dust 
 stagecoachman admiring eye
given lost equipage whipped 

horses gain station time 
halfpast clock train 
sinking darkest corner empty
coach sobbed bitterly

 end
