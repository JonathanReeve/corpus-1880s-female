 sickened sweetness poetry

 longed life realities relief
 inaction world strife 
 stranded isolated existence
 mood altered 
tears marvelled presumption 
questioning god decree surely 
punishment slight grievous
failing 
surrounded care desolate
barren shore amidst fairest 
god works reminded 
 barlow bright happy life shadowed
 shortened quenched hopes 
 companions colonel wasting
form vanished dreams 
 brave efforts content
 smith thwarted ambitions 
 mole uncomplaining selfforgetfulness
 sorrows touched 
diverted thoughts 
looked round glories land 
sea sky 

appeared fair stretching arms
 adoration repeated verse 
grand old hymn 

wide world thy command

vast eternity thy 
firm rock thy truth stand
 rolling years cease move

suddenly ceased sprang 
feet possessed sudden madness
 shrieked scream 
rang loud high dash 
waters woodland 
making rest community start
arid listen fly pursuits
 agonized excitement 
 piercing uttered 
 vainly hoped
 hear sail sail
